/**
 * This function generates the FileInfo tree.
 * It starts with the entry TypeScript file and traverse all its imports.
 *
 * It does not follow an import when it is an external library, i.e. comes from
 * node_modules. The same is true, if a file is already traversed.
 *
 * To improve the testability, we use abstraction whenever access to the
 * filesystem happens. In case the abstraction does not emulate the original's
 * behaviour, "strange bugs" might occur. Look out for them.
 *
 * fixPathSeparators is necessary to replace the static '/' path separator
 * with the one from the OS.
 *
 * @param fsPath Filename to traverse from
 * @param fileInfoDict Dictionary of traversed files to catch circularity
 * @param tsData
 * @param runOnce traverse only once. needed for ESLint mode
 * @param fileContent if passed, is used instead the content of @fsPath.
 * necessary for unsaved files inESLint
